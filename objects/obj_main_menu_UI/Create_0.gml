		"It’s been exactly 2 months since you first landed in the distant planet Euboxia. You were once the loyal helper to a great Star Lord in your outer space travels. However, your space ship was hit by a massive asteroid, and you crash-landed into the planet closest to you — Euboxia.",
		"You caused the Villies quite a shock! The Villies are the beings on this planet — well-to-do, little people who have ordinary lives and jobs.",
		"Since they found you, the Villies have taken care of you. They gave you food, clothes, money, a bed with pillows and blankets, some farm animals so that you could make your own food and sell it…and even your own home.",
		"You have since settled down amongst the Villy Nillies, who are now your friends. You have your own job and wake up to work like everybody else.",
		"However, you feel the desire to do more. To help more. To bring some good into the world and a smile on your friends’ faces. To do what no one else can do. You want to solve problems, discover, and explore new adventures every day.",
		"Most of all, you want to have a name and have an important role to play. You are hard working and are very good at solving challenges. Maybe…just maybe, someday you’ll also want to become a hero.",
		"It’s time to make your move! Step into the world of Euboxia and start your story."
